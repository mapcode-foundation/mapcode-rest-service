/**
 * This class provides a safe start up of the system. It provides basic checks required before startup is allowed. It
 * is
 * abound as an eager Singleton by Guice in the {@link com.mapcode.services.deployment.DeploymentModule}
 * by using "binder.bind(StartupCheck.class).asEagerSingleton()". This means the Singleton is instantiated right away.
 * <p> If any of the checks in the constructor of this class fail, an IllegalStateException is thrown and the
 * application will not continue to run. This prevents starting the system with, for example, incorrect database
 * information or an incompatible JRE.

         * Another good one is checking the expected character set (see below) and the JRE version.
